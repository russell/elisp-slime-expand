* elisp-slime-expand

  This minor mode adds similar functionality to the SLIME macroexpand
  mode.  It's activated using /C-x RET/ and then support further
  macro expansion in the macro view.  It also does macroexpand-all
  using /C-x M-m/.

  Once in the macroexpand view /g/ can be used to refresh the macro
  expansion and /q/ will bury the buffer.

** Installation

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (require 'elisp-slime-expand)
   (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda () (elisp-slime-expand-mode t)))
   #+END_SRC
** Known Issues

   There is currently one known issue where pretty printing fails due
   to formatting of strings in the function definition.  This should
   probably be fixed in the cl-extras package instead of in this module.
